            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Cabbage Worm Infestation is caused by the larvae of the Cabbage White Butterfly, <i>Pieris rapae</i>. These pests are notorious for feeding on cabbage and other cruciferous crops, leading to significant damage. They can rapidly consume large portions of the leaves, reducing crop yield and quality.</p>

            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <div class="symptoms">
                <h3>Symptoms on Leaves</h3>
                <p>Leaves may exhibit ragged holes and torn edges. The worms are often found on the undersides of leaves, where they feed and hide. Their feeding can lead to severe defoliation, leaving plants stunted and unable to recover.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Fruit</h3>
                <p>Cabbage heads may show signs of feeding, with irregular holes and dark green worm droppings. In severe cases, the heads may become unmarketable due to excessive damage.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Twigs</h3>
                <p>While twigs are less commonly affected, young plants may suffer from damage to the growing tips, which can stunt growth and lead to malformed heads.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <div class="cultural-control">
                <h3>Cultural Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Regularly inspect plants and remove any worms by hand. Destroy infested plant debris to reduce the number of overwintering larvae.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> Carefully prune infested leaves to prevent the spread of worms to healthy parts of the plant. Avoid excessive pruning that could stress the plant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Consider planting cabbage varieties that are less attractive to cabbage worms, such as those with stronger natural defenses or tougher leaves.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Maintain adequate water supply, as healthy plants are more resilient to pest damage. However, avoid overwatering, as it can create a more favorable environment for pests.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="chemical-control">
                <h3>Chemical Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fungicides:</strong> While fungicides are not effective against cabbage worms, there are specific insecticides that target these pests. Use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) as a biological control, which is safe for non-target organisms and effective against larvae.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Apply insecticides early in the morning or late in the evening when cabbage worms are most active. Timing applications just before egg hatch is crucial to maximizing effectiveness.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="disposal">
                <h3>Proper Disposal</h3>
                <p>Dispose of infested plants by burning or burying them deeply in the soil. This helps prevent the spread of the pests and reduces the likelihood of future infestations.</p>

        <p>If the infestation becomes severe or persists despite your efforts, consult with a local agricultural extension service or a professional pest management advisor for further assistance and tailored advice.</p>
