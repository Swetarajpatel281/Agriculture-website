        <section class="overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Stripe Rust, caused by the fungus <i>Puccinia striiformis</i>, is a serious disease affecting wheat and other cereals. It is characterized by yellowish stripes on the leaves and can significantly reduce yields and quality. The disease thrives in cool, moist conditions and can spread rapidly if not controlled effectively.</p>

        <section class="identification">
            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <div class="symptoms">
                <h3>Symptoms on Fruit</h3>
                <p>Stripe Rust does not directly affect the fruit. However, severe leaf infection can lead to reduced grain filling and lower grain quality.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Leaves</h3>
                <p>Leaves exhibit elongated, yellowish-orange pustules or stripes. These pustules contain spores that spread the disease. As the disease progresses, the leaves turn yellow and may wither, leading to reduced photosynthesis and overall plant health.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Twigs</h3>
                <p>Twigs or stems may also show signs of infection with yellowish stripes. While less common, severe infections can weaken the plant and lead to lodging or stem breakage.</p>

        <section class="solution">
            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <div class="cultural-control">
                <h3>Cultural Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected crop residues and volunteers in the field. Proper field sanitation reduces the initial inoculum for the next season.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> In cereal crops, pruning is not typically applicable. Focus on removing infected plant parts and maintaining good field hygiene.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Use wheat varieties that are resistant to Stripe Rust. Consult with local agricultural extension services for the latest recommendations on resistant cultivars.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Maintain optimal soil moisture levels. Avoid overwatering as excessive moisture can create favorable conditions for fungal growth. Ensure proper drainage to reduce disease pressure.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="chemical-control">
                <h3>Chemical Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fungicides:</strong> Apply fungicides that are effective against Stripe Rust. Recommended products include those containing active ingredients such as propiconazole or tebuconazole. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for application rates and timing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Apply fungicides preventively at the early stages of disease development or based on disease forecasting models. Early application is critical to prevent the spread of the disease.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="disposal">
                <h3>Proper Disposal</h3>
                <p>Dispose of infected plant material by burning or deep burying it. Avoid composting infected residues to prevent the spread of the disease to other fields.</p>
            </div>

        <p>If Stripe Rust becomes severe or persists despite control efforts, consult with local agricultural experts for additional management strategies and tailored advice.</p>
