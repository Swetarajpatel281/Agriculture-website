            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Alternaria Leaf Blight is a fungal disease caused by <i>Alternaria</i> species, which affects a wide range of crops, including tomatoes, peppers, and potatoes. The disease is characterized by dark, irregular spots on leaves, stems, and fruits, leading to reduced plant vigor and yield. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and can spread rapidly if not managed effectively.</p>

            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <div class="symptoms">
                <h3>Symptoms on Fruit</h3>
                <p>Fruits may develop small, dark lesions that grow into larger, sunken spots. These lesions can be surrounded by a yellow halo and often lead to premature fruit drop and reduced quality.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Leaves</h3>
                <p>Leaves exhibit irregular, dark spots with concentric rings. The affected areas may dry out and become brittle, leading to premature leaf drop and reduced photosynthesis.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Twigs</h3>
                <p>Twigs may show dark, sunken lesions that can expand and girdle the stem. This can weaken the plant and cause dieback of the affected branches.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <div class="cultural-control">
                <h3>Cultural Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Regularly remove and dispose of infected plant debris and fallen leaves. Clean garden tools and equipment to prevent the spread of fungal spores.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> Prune affected leaves and branches to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the plant. This helps minimize conditions favorable to fungal growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Opt for plant varieties that are resistant or tolerant to Alternaria Leaf Blight. These varieties are less likely to suffer significant damage and reduce the need for chemical treatments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid overhead irrigation to reduce leaf wetness. Use drip irrigation to provide water directly to the root zone, minimizing moisture on the leaves and reducing disease risk.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="chemical-control">
                <h3>Chemical Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fungicides:</strong> Apply fungicides with active ingredients such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, or copper-based products. These fungicides can help manage Alternaria Leaf Blight when used according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Apply fungicides before disease symptoms appear and during critical growth stages. Reapply after heavy rain or high humidity to maintain effective protection against the fungus.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="disposal">
                <h3>Proper Disposal</h3>
                <p>Dispose of infected plant material by burning or burying it to prevent the spread of the disease. Avoid composting affected materials unless you can ensure that the compost will reach temperatures high enough to kill the fungal spores.</p>

        <p>If the disease persists or becomes severe, consult with a local agricultural extension service or a plant pathologist for further assistance and tailored recommendations.</p>
