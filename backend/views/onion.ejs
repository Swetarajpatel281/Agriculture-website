            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Onion Neck Rot is a fungal disease caused by <i>Botrytis allii</i> that primarily affects stored onions, leading to significant post-harvest losses. The disease is most prevalent in cool, wet conditions and can be particularly devastating if not managed properly before and during storage.</p>

            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <div class="symptoms">
                <h3>Symptoms on Bulbs</h3>
                <p>Infected onion bulbs develop a soft, watery rot at the neck, which may progress downwards, causing the entire bulb to rot. The affected area is often covered with a greyish mold, and the inner scales may become discolored and soft.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Leaves</h3>
                <p>Infected leaves may exhibit yellowing and wilting, particularly near the neck. This can lead to premature senescence and reduced yield.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Stems</h3>
                <p>The stems may become soft and collapse, especially around the neck region, leading to the overall weakening of the plant and making it more susceptible to other pathogens.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <div class="cultural-control">
                <h3>Cultural Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Regularly remove and destroy any crop debris or infected plant material to reduce the spread of fungal spores. Ensure that onions are thoroughly cured before storage to reduce moisture content, which can promote disease development.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> Remove any weak or infected leaves during the growing season to minimize the risk of disease spread. Pruning should be done carefully to avoid damaging the neck, which can provide an entry point for the pathogen.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Opt for onion varieties that are bred for resistance to Neck Rot. These varieties typically have tighter necks and thicker skins, which can help prevent infection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid overhead irrigation, especially late in the season, to prevent water from accumulating around the necks of onions. Drip irrigation can be a better alternative as it keeps the foliage dry and reduces the risk of infection.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="chemical-control">
                <h3>Chemical Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fungicides:</strong> Apply fungicides that are effective against <i>Botrytis</i> species, such as iprodione or boscalid, before harvest and during storage. Ensure that the fungicide is labeled for use on onions and follow the manufacturer's guidelines for application.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Apply fungicides at critical growth stages, particularly when the onions are nearing maturity and during storage preparation. Early and consistent application is key to preventing the establishment and spread of the pathogen.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="proper-disposal">
                <h3>Proper Disposal</h3>
                <p>Dispose of any infected onions properly by burying them deep in the soil or burning them. This will help prevent the spread of the fungus to healthy crops and minimize the risk of future outbreaks.</p>
