            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Apple Scab is a fungal disease caused by <i>Venturia inaequalis</i> that affects apple trees. This disease can cause significant damage to the fruit, leaves, and stems, reducing both yield and quality. It thrives in cool, moist conditions and can spread rapidly if not managed properly.</p>

            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <div class="symptoms">
                <h3>Symptoms on Fruit</h3>
                <p>Look for dark, velvety spots or scabs on the apples. These lesions can enlarge and crack as the fruit grows, making the apples less attractive and more susceptible to rot.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Leaves</h3>
                <p>Leaves may develop olive-green to black spots, which may eventually turn brown. Infected leaves often become distorted and can fall off prematurely, affecting the tree’s overall health.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Twigs</h3>
                <p>Twigs may develop dark, sunken lesions, which can lead to dieback if the infection is severe.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <div class="cultural-control">
                <h3>Cultural Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Regularly remove and destroy fallen leaves and infected fruit to decrease the number of fungal spores in the environment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> Prune your apple trees to improve air circulation and sunlight penetration. This helps reduce humidity around the leaves and makes conditions less favorable for fungal growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Consider planting apple varieties that are resistant to Apple Scab. These varieties are less likely to be affected by the disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid overhead irrigation and water the base of the tree to minimize moisture on the leaves, which helps prevent disease spread.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="chemical-control">
                <h3>Chemical Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fungicides:</strong> Use fungicides specifically targeted at Apple Scab. Apply them according to the manufacturer’s instructions, starting early in the spring and continuing as needed during the growing season. Common options include Captan, Myclobutanil, and Mancozeb.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Timing is crucial. Apply fungicides during critical periods, especially after rain or during periods of high humidity when the disease is likely to spread.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="disposal">
                <h3>Proper Disposal</h3>
                <p>Dispose of infected plant material properly. Burning or burying it can help prevent the spread of the disease to other plants.</p>

        <p>If the infection becomes severe or persists despite your efforts, consult with a local agricultural extension service or a professional arborist for further assistance and tailored advice.</p>
