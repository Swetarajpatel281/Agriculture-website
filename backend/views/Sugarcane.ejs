            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Sugarcane Smut is a fungal disease caused by <i>Sporisorium scitamineum</i>, which affects sugarcane crops by producing black whip-like structures at the top of infected stalks. This disease can lead to reduced yields and poor-quality sugar production, posing a significant threat to the industry.</p>

            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <div class="symptoms">
                <h3>Symptoms on Stalks</h3>
                <p>Infected stalks produce black, whip-like structures (smut whips) at their tips. These whips are the most characteristic symptom of the disease.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Leaves</h3>
                <p>Leaves may become twisted and narrow, with a reduction in the overall growth of the plant. The leaves might also show chlorosis, where they turn yellowish due to poor health.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Buds</h3>
                <p>Buds may fail to develop properly, leading to poor tillering and overall stunted growth of the plant. This often results in fewer stalks per clump.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <div class="cultural-control">
                <h3>Cultural Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to prevent the spread of the disease. Use clean planting materials from disease-free areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> Regularly remove smut whips and other infected parts of the plant to minimize disease spread.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Plant smut-resistant varieties of sugarcane that are less likely to be affected by the disease.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Ensure proper drainage in the fields to reduce the likelihood of infection, as waterlogged conditions can promote fungal growth.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="chemical-control">
                <h3>Chemical Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fungicides:</strong> Apply fungicides such as Propiconazole or Triadimefon to the base of the plants. These fungicides have shown effectiveness in controlling Sugarcane Smut when applied during the early stages of infection.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Apply fungicides at the first sign of smut whips or symptoms. Reapply after heavy rains or during periods of high humidity when the risk of infection is increased.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="disposal">
                <h3>Proper Disposal</h3>
                <p>Burn or deeply bury infected plant material to prevent the spread of spores to healthy plants. Avoid using infected plants as mulch or compost.</p>

        <p>If the disease persists despite your efforts, consult with local agricultural experts for further advice and advanced treatment options.</p>
