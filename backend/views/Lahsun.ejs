            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Allium Leaf Miner is an invasive pest that primarily targets allium crops such as onions, garlic, and leeks. The pest is the larval stage of a fly that lays eggs in the leaves of the host plants. The larvae then burrow through the leaves and stems, causing significant damage and often leading to secondary infections by pathogens.</p>

            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <div class="symptoms">
                <h3>Symptoms on Fruit</h3>
                <p>Allium Leaf Miner does not directly affect the fruit, but the damage to the leaves and stems can lead to poor bulb development and reduced yield quality.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Leaves</h3>
                <p>Leaves may show linear mines or trails as larvae feed between the leaf layers. Leaves can become distorted and develop dark blotches where eggs were laid. The damage often leads to wilting and premature yellowing.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Twigs</h3>
                <p>While twigs are not typically affected, stems may become weak and exhibit signs of larval tunneling, making the plant more susceptible to collapse.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <div class="cultural-control">
                <h3>Cultural Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Remove and destroy infested plant material immediately after harvesting. Clean tools and equipment to prevent the spread of larvae or eggs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> Prune damaged leaves and stems as soon as they show signs of infestation. This reduces the number of larvae present and minimizes further damage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Research is ongoing to develop allium varieties that are less attractive or more resistant to the Allium Leaf Miner. Stay updated with agricultural extension services for recommendations on resistant strains.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid overhead irrigation which can promote moist conditions favorable to pest infestation. Use drip irrigation to minimize leaf wetness and deter egg-laying.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="chemical-control">
                <h3>Chemical Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fungicides:</strong> While fungicides are not effective against the Allium Leaf Miner itself, applying systemic insecticides early in the growing season can help control larvae before they cause significant damage. Products containing spinosad or neem oil are recommended.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Timing is crucial. Apply insecticides when adult flies are most active, typically in spring and autumn. Reapply after heavy rains, which may wash away protective treatments.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="disposal">
                <h3>Proper Disposal</h3>
                <p>Dispose of infested plant material by burning or burying it deeply to prevent larvae from completing their life cycle. Avoid composting infested material unless you are sure the compost will reach temperatures high enough to kill all stages of the pest.</p>

        <p>If the infestation persists or becomes severe, consult with a local agricultural extension service or a professional for tailored advice and potential biological control options.</p>
