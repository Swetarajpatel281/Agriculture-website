            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Anthracnose is a fungal disease caused by various species of the genus <i>Colletotrichum</i>. It affects a wide range of crops, including fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants. The disease is characterized by dark, sunken lesions that can lead to significant yield loss and reduced quality of produce. It thrives in warm, humid conditions and can spread rapidly through rain splashes and contaminated tools.</p>

            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <div class="symptoms">
                <h3>Symptoms on Fruit</h3>
                <p>Fruits affected by Anthracnose develop dark, sunken lesions with a reddish or pinkish hue. These lesions may coalesce, leading to extensive fruit rot and premature fruit drop. The fruit’s surface becomes soft and mushy, rendering it unfit for consumption or sale.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Leaves</h3>
                <p>On leaves, Anthracnose causes small, dark spots with a yellow halo. These spots enlarge over time, leading to leaf drop and reduced photosynthetic ability. Severe infections can cause significant defoliation, weakening the plant.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Twigs</h3>
                <p>Twigs may exhibit dark, sunken lesions that can girdle and kill the twig if left untreated. These lesions often appear as dark streaks or cankers, which can lead to dieback and reduced plant vigor.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <div class="cultural-control">
                <h3>Cultural Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> Regularly remove and destroy infected plant debris, including fallen fruit and leaves. Clean tools and equipment with a disinfectant to prevent the spread of fungal spores.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pruning:</strong> Prune affected branches and leaves to improve air circulation and reduce humidity around the plant. This helps in minimizing the ideal conditions for fungal growth.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resistant Varieties:</strong> Select and plant varieties that have been bred for resistance to Anthracnose. Research local agricultural extensions for the latest recommendations on resistant cultivars.</li>
                    <li><strong>Water Management:</strong> Avoid overhead irrigation and water the base of plants directly. Ensure proper drainage to reduce the moisture level on plant surfaces, which helps prevent disease spread.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="chemical-control">
                <h3>Chemical Control</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fungicides:</strong> Apply fungicides that are effective against <i>Colletotrichum</i> species, such as products containing chlorothalonil or azoxystrobin. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for application rates and intervals.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Begin fungicide applications at the first sign of disease and continue at regular intervals, especially during periods of high humidity and after rain. Early and consistent application is crucial to managing Anthracnose effectively.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="disposal">
                <h3>Proper Disposal</h3>
                <p>Dispose of infected plant material by burning or burying it deeply to prevent further spread of the disease. Avoid composting infected material unless you are certain that the compost will reach temperatures high enough to kill the pathogen.</p>
