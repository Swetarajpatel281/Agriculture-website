            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Black Sigatoka, caused by the fungus <i>Mycosphaerella fijiensis</i>, is a severe disease affecting banana crops worldwide. The disease leads to significant yield losses and reduced fruit quality if not managed effectively. It thrives in warm, humid conditions, making it particularly problematic in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

            <h2>Identification</h2>
            <div class="symptoms">
                <h3>Symptoms on Fruit</h3>
                <p>Bananas may develop dark streaks or spots, which eventually lead to premature ripening and reduced market value.</p>
                <h3>Symptoms on Leaves</h3>
                <p>Leaves exhibit dark, elongated streaks, which may merge to form large necrotic areas. This reduces the photosynthetic capacity of the plant, leading to stunted growth and lower yields.</p>

            <h2>Solution</h2>
            <div class="biocontrol">
                <h3>Biocontrol with Endophytic Fungi</h3>
                <p>Introducing beneficial endophytic fungi into banana plants can help control Black Sigatoka by outcompeting or inhibiting the pathogenic fungus.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Isolation:</strong> Identify and isolate beneficial fungi from healthy banana plants.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inoculation:</strong> Introduce the fungi into young plants through seed treatment or root dip.</li>
                    <li><strong>Field Trials:</strong> Monitor the efficacy and impact on yield and quality through controlled trials.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="ai-monitoring">
                <h3>AI-Based Monitoring</h3>
                <p>Use AI and IoT technologies to predict and monitor disease outbreaks, enabling timely and effective intervention.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gather environmental data to predict disease outbreaks.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI Modeling:</strong> Develop predictive models for disease progression.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Monitoring:</strong> Use sensors to provide real-time updates on conditions favorable to the disease.</li>
